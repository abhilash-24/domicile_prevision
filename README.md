  <center><h3>DOMICILE PRE-VISION – HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION</h3>
<i>(Bachelors Project Summary)</i>
<p>Real Estate is one of the booming businesses in today’s world. With the exponential growth of demand for houses or plots, there is an increasing need for transparency between a buyer and the seller. Considering the need of having a system that can aid the buyer and the seller in making well-informed decisions, we designed and built a prototype that can predict the price of a property, taking factors like the geographic location, area of the house, features of the house, amenities available and so on into consideration. The project uses three regression models, linear regression, random forest models, and boosted regression. Datasets that are fed into the models were foraged from Kaggle* and the final model is hosted on a Java Server Page with data pertaining to users and credentials stored in a SQL database. The efficiency of the model currently lies at eighty-nine percent, with a lot of room for improvement and upgradation. The project could further accommodate Google map APIs, to capture the exact location of the asset, enabling the application to expand its scope worldwide.</p>
